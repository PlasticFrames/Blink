### What is Blink?

Blink (published as [The Last Flight of Captain Nimbus](https://glitterbeard.itch.io/the-last-flight-of-captain-nimbus)) is an isometric action prototype developed over six weeks in Unity as part of Tranzfuser's 2021 Employment Pathway. It was designed and programmed by myself (T Godden) in collaboration with a friend (JimmyMac) who created the 3D art, sourced assets and assisted with coding.

As a technical designer, I was responsible for developing and refining the core mechanics in documentation and prototype form as well as managing version control and the implementation of assets as prefabs and discrete instances. As the technical lead, I also spent a lot of time bug-fixing and iterating upon those implementations.

### What did I learn?

We scoped the project well, however; we still found ourselves limited by our team size of two as it was difficult to balance designing and iterating upon the core mechanics with the technical problems we had to overcome. This ultimately led us to pare back our vision for the game and focus on refining the dash mechanic and enemy behaviours rather than adding the environmental power-ups I had initially outlined.

A specific technical hurdle I had to overcome was the use of prefabs, as switching to them later in the project invalidated some of the original code. I used a prefab of the player throughout but refrained from prefabbing other objects until they were functional, which ultimately resulted in having to comb through multiple scripts to check implementation and rewrite declarations.

### Why did I present this?

Blink demonstrates my ability to manage a project, design layed mechanics and prototype a coherent experience in a relatively short amount of time. It also highlights how I was able to combine various Unity functionality with personal and online resources to create distinct and compelling gameplay which is suitable for expansion based on the original design work and/or player feedback, be it adding power-ups or developing platforming levels.
